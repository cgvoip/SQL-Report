SQL-Report
==========

Create Report using Bash Shell Scripting
This recipe combines the power of SQL, shell scripts, cron, and mail to 
automate a task such as sending daily performance reports. 

With any type of automation task, first you need to create a script that encapsulates the job that will 
be automated. Once you're confident that the script is ready, then schedule the job to run from cron. 
The log file allows you to check to make sure job is running as intended.
